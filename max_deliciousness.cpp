// // PROBLEM
// A new patisserie has opened up to rave reviews. You, in your quest for deliciousness, are going to visit it.
// The patisserie has N pastries. With your trained eye, you judge that the i-th of them has deliciousness Ai
// â€‹Of course, you want to eat pastries whose total deliciousness is as high as possible. Unfortunately, you can't just buy everything out.
// There are K customers in the store, including you. They form a queue to order pastries, of which you're the L-th person.
// Each customer, including you, will do the following:
// Among the remaining pastries, buy the one with the highest deliciousness
// Then, move to the back of the queue
// This will repeat till all the pastries are sold out.
// What's the total deliciousness of the pastries you buy?
